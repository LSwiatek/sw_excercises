Write a program which will count score for bowling.
Bowling game consists of 10 Frames. In each frame you may roll up to twice
* if in first roll you do not knonck down all the pins, you may roll again
* if first roll knocks down all pins, then it a Strike, and it is the end of frame
* if you knock down all 10 pins in 2 rolls, then it is a Spare

Scoring is based on the following:
* if frame is a Strike, then you get 10 plus the sum of the next 2 throws
* if frame is a Spare, then you get 10 plus the value of the next throw
* otherwise you get sum of knocked down pins in the frame

If the last frame is Strike, then you may roll 2 additional times
if last frame is Spare, then you may roll 1 additional time

Max score is 300

Program should accept an array where each value represents a roll and it is the number of pins knocked down (0-10)
Program should output the score
